# msp430watch

These are the source, binary and design files for my MSP430 based wrist watch.

See https://hackaday.io/project/163005-msp430fr5994-based-wrist-watch for project write up and documentation.

This project was designed for me to personally learn more about electronics design and embedded software design. As such, there are guaranteed to be bugs, issues and things that can be improved. I recommend not taking any of my instructions or designs at face value. However, I do have a working device so I must of done something right(ish).
